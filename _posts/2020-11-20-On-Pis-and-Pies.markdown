title : "On Pis and Pies"

	Pi is an interesting number. It's maybe the most well known of the irrational numbers and is the most well known transcendental number which is a number that can not be written using roots and such. But what makes it distinctive is how ubiquitous in math it is. It pops up everywhere. But there is a curious thing. Whenever pi shows up it can either always or almost always connected to a circle. Even the sum of the inverse squares of the natural numbers equaling six over pi, which doesn't seem to have anything to do with circles uses the sine function which is all circles. So if in math you see pi, look for a circle. And if in life you see a pie, look for a circle anyway.
