title : "The problem with standardised tests"
---
Standardised test have a problem: they are standardised. Although this makes it easy to compare results when education systems are based around standardised tests the focus slips from learning to doing well on the tests. Teachers will not talk in depth about a subject because "it won't be in the test", students will not try to learn anything outside the curriculum because it won't make any difference accademicly.
