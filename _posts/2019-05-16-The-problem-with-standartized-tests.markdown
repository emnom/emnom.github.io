title : "The problem with standardised tests"
---
Standardised test have a problem: they are standardised. Although this makes it easy to compare results when the education system is based around standardised tests the focus slips from learning to doing well on the exams. Teachers will not talk in depth about a subject because "it won't be in the exam", students will not try to learn anything outside the curriculum because it won't make any difference academically. 

I am not an academist so my outlook on this topic may be flawed. The best thing to do would be to change the "exams above all" mindset. Changing a mindset is easier said than done though especially one so deep-seated. The solution to this is to fix the system. Fix the system and the surrounding problems solve themselves. To fix the system maybe make standardised tests not the only way of advancing academically? As I said I'm not an academist. 

These days people focus more on passing the exams than actually learning stuff. We have to fix this.
