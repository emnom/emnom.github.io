I was on a school trip when we went into a maze. A friend said "Put your left hand on the wall and follow it".It was not
that hard to see why that was true. Think of a maze as a closed graph with two line segments denoting the entrance and the exit.
If you traverse the perimeter of the graph you will pass every line segment. So there will be a path from the entrance line segment to the exit line segment.QED
