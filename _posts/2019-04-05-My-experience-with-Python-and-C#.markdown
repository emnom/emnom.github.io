title : "My experience with Python and c#"
---
I learned some Python (a programming language). I wanted to write a game someday. 
But writing a game in Python is 𝘏𝘢𝘳𝘥. So I knew I eventually would have to switch to 
some other programming language. I'm not saying games aren't writeable in Python just
that 𝑰 can't do it. I was trying to do something and it wasn't doable in Python.

So I thought: "Now is a good time to learn another programming language". 
Because Unity works with C# I decided to learn C#. The really really basic stuff
isn't actually that different. But some things really stood out : "What do you 
mean you can't define functions in C#" (You can write something with a similar 
function though, no pun intended). Classes are just another tool in Python and
one I never fully grasped but C# is based on Classes. There were some things 
that were really interesting: like the ability to calculate the output only 
when requested. I still like Python more for its simplicity but I can see the
things C# would be useful for.
