title: "A Very Meta Post"

I always have trouble with writing interesting blog posts. It's more the fact
that I can't find interesting topics to write about instead of an inability to write
well. It always works like this: I think to myself, I should find an interesting topic.
I think for a while and come up blank so I delay writing it for a while. Rinse and 
repeat. The way to break this loop is obvious:  Write about not especially interesting
topics. It's hard to get out of the mindset that every post should be something
unique but it's necessary if you want to write finished posts regularly. And 
that's why I wrote a blog post about writing blog posts.
