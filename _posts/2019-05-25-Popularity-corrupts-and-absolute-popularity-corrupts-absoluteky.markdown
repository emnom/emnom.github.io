Why is it so hard to find good content in youtube? A lot of the youtubers drastically reduce the quality of their videos once they gain popularity. This, combined with popular things being easier to find makes it a lot harder to find good _and_ new content. 

Why do popular youtubers with bad quality videos stay popular? Because once you are popular you can stay popular by doing popular thing instead of making quality content. New people come because their friends are watching you; people see the bad content but don't go away because everybody is watching you etc. This, combined with the pressure to make more and more content makes the quality of the content go down. 

What can we do about this? It's easy. Just stop watching things just because they're popular. After all it can't be popular if people don't watch it.
