Because I have not written much I have very little experience in the art of writing so this will mostly be what other
people say.
The opinions differ from _good_ fiction is harder than _good_ nonfiction to everyone is different. I haven't
seen anyone say good nonfiction is harder than good fiction. Although, it seems that everybody who said good fiction is
harder than good nonfiction seems to agree that _bad_ fiction is easier than bad nonfiction. As I said I have little
experience but even then, I have only written nonfiction (this blog) so I can't make any comparisons.
In nonfiction the research is time-consuming but in fiction you have to create everything yourself. In fiction you
have to give things depth but in fiction you have to stick close to the facts.
In the end the answer probably is (as with all things like this): It changes from peson to person.
