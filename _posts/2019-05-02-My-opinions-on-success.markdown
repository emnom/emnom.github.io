I think that success is when you can look back and think: "Wow, how much I have come" (passed time doesn't 
count: you can't spend all your life doing nothing and call it success). And not just in the sense of 
achievements either, self-improvement also counts. This also allows you to feel really good about your
achievements. After all what good is achieveing something if you can't feel good about it. And finally
success should be for yourself. Like they say: do it for yourself. Your goal should be something you
want. Don't let others decide the course of your life.
