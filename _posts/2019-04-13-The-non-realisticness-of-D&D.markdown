This may sound weird but I like the non-realisticness of D&D (aside from the obvious magic and elves and yadda yadda yadda). For
example unless your hit points reaches 0 loss of hitpoints usually doesn't change anything. If it were realistic you would for example
start hitting less and less the more wounded you get. While the non-realisticness does appeal to the power fantasy(The sense
of empowerment that games often bring) by enabling you to do things you couldn't to if the game were more realistic, it's not the main
reason. Though the limitations of a tabletop game limit the realisticness of such a game, the non-realisticness adds depth to the game:
It's not just a poorly made simulation. D&D makes randomness fun. And It isn't the kind of fun gambling brings. In gambling the part
that's fun is the part where you win. In D&D the randomness, the uncertainty that you're going to succeed at something is fun. A more
realistic D&D couldn't depend that much on dice rolls.
